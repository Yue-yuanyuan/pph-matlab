# pph-matlab

Matlab code for computing path persistent homology of directed networks. 
The current implementation computes PPH up to homology dimension 1.

Chowdhury, S. and MÃ©moli, F., Persistent Path Homology of Directed Networks. To appear in SODA 2018.


### Example usage

A = rand(5).*(~eye(5)); % vertices appear at time 0, PPH cares about the entry of (directed) edges

pers = computePPH(A,max(max(A)))
