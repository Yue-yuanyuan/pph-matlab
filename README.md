# pph-matlab

Matlab code for computing path persistent homology of directed networks. 
The current implementation computes PPH up to homology dimension 1.

Chowdhury, S. and MÃ©moli, F., Persistent Path Homology of Directed Networks. To appear in SODA 2018.


### Example usage

A = rand(5).*(~eye(5)); % vertices appear at time 0, PPH cares about the entry of (directed) edges

pers = computePPH(A,max(max(A)))


### Further testing with cycle networks

load cycle_nets.mat 

A{3}

// A{3} should be a 5x5 matrix with entries 0 1 2 3 4 on top row
   
pers = computePPH(A{3},4); 

pers{2}

ans = 

   1  3

// More generally, A{n} contains a cycle network on (n+2) nodes, maximum weight = (n+1). 
By the characterization result in our paper, the 1-dimensional PPH of this object should be 
a single interval (1, ceil(n/2)).
